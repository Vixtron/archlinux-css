This is currently in work, covering most of the website's CSS.

**TO INSTALL**: You need to extract this in your chrome directory located at: <br />
`~/.mozilla/firefox/.profile/chrome/userChrome.css` <br />
Restart your Firefox and you are ready to go!

# Want custom colors?
Edit the following to your own liking:

```css
:root {
--bg-color: #rrggbb;

}
```
